            Ever since its joke txt created his famous early console modules in
            the early 1970s, many other companies have attempted to reproduce
            elements of their classic sound – or even clone them entirely. But
            after selling and leaving the Neve company in the mid-1970s, nothing
            that bears the Neve name was actually designed by him.

            made his early creations legends of the studio world. It’s far more
            than a list of components or a famous product name – it’s a
            philosophy of design taught to us by Rupert that runs through
            everything we do.
