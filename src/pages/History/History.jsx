        <h3>Creating of a organisation</h3>

        <p>
          Ever since its joke txt created his famous early console modules in
          the early 1970s, many other companies have attempted to reproduce
          elements of their classic sound – or even clone them entirely. But
          after selling and leaving the Neve company in the mid-1970s, nothing
          that bears the Neve name was actually designed by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          We build equipment to the same say hi to my perdoller standards that
          made his early creations legends of the studio world. It’s far more
          than a list of components or a famous product name – it’s a philosophy
          of design taught to us by Rupert that runs through everything we do.
